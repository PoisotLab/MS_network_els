* based on graph theory (partie succinte, par obliger d'écrire trois paragraphes la dessus)
  - graph G, vertices V and edges E
  - matrix algebra : ad
* explanation of what is a graph, a vertex/node and an edge
  - directed/undirected interactions (the norm for the arrow direction in a directed interaction is, in a food web for example, from the prey to the predator (it refers to the transfert of "ernergy" /based on the nutrient flux convention))
  - weighted/unweighted interactions
  - how the représentation of this two kind of networks differs, for instance in a adjency matrix (symetric when the network is undirected, 0/1 for unweighted, ...)
* Basic properties of a network: number of nodes = order, number of edges = size
  - number of nodes = order, number of edges = size
  - node degree (number of link by node) (in and out degree in directed network)
  - distance between two nodes (if combined with connectance, gives an idea of more or less the shape of the network if combine with connectance)
* wide range of available measures :
  basics, as connectance, species richness, etc.
  others, depending on the question asked/the goal reach
    nestedness, modularity, centrality, phylogeny, etc.
    degree/links distributions, detection of key species, ...
  used to define ecological network properties
* different types of ecological networks : mutualistic vs. antagonistic  
  - pollination [\(Dalsgaard et al., 2011\)](#@dalsgaard2011) (hummingbird-plant network), [\(Bascompte, Jordano, Melián, & Olesen, 2003\)](#@bascompte2003) (structure of mutualistic networks)  
  - parasitism (host-parasite : parasitoid-aphids, ...) [\(Derocles et al., 2014\)](#@derocles2014) (level of compartmentalization in aphid-parasitoid network), [\(Poulin, 2010\)](#@poulin2010) (review of analyses of the community structure in an host-parasit network)
  - predator-prey (food web => food web length often limited to 5 or 6 steps? => links with small world effect and properties? ref?) [\(Zander, Bersier, & Gray, 2016\)](#@zander2016) (temparature variation effects on the different levels of food web)
* study of ecological networks used for theoretical and applied ecology
  - pest control
  - ecosystem functioning
  - evolution and adaptation
  - conservation/restoration
  - biological application of network analysis (genetic, metabolic pathway, etc.) that can be used in ecology
* notion of top, intermediate and basal species (valid especially in food web) : top species (consommateurs secondaires) : species which predate on over species ; basal species (producteurs primaires) : species which are predates by other species ; intermediate species : species which predate on and are predated by other species in the food chain/web
* difficulty to compare different network and within network due to the precision of data (definition of taxa or species : it is easier to identify the species of a wolf than a planton) gave birth at the term "trophic species": node/"species" that share the same interactions in the network
* ecological network structure and composition and what does it mean for the ecosystem (ecosystem functioning, functional role of species, stability, robustness, etc.)
* studies based on interactions, energetic/methabolic flux, genetic or phylogenetic links between species/trophic level/...
* scale of studies : global (community) to local (population) (is there a sense to study at the scale of the population for an ecological aim? I'm not sure)
* predictions and models (Brose? -> Eva? :) )
* species and populations dynamics (Lotka-Volta dynamics, which else?)
* one way to study species interactions is to study their similarity (realtionship that they share?)
