Its drivers in competitive systems (sampling effect and functional complementarity) are intuitive and elegant, but we lack an integrative understanding of these drivers in complex ecosystems. Because networks encompass two key components of the BEF relationship (species richness and biomass flow), they provide a key to identify these drivers, assuming that we have a meaningful measure of functional complementarity. In a network, diversity can be defined by species richness, the number of trophic levels, but perhaps more importantly, the diversity of interactions. In this paper, we define the concept of trophic complementarity (TC), which emerges through exploitative and apparent competition processes, and study its contribution to ecosystem functioning. Using a model of trophic community dynamics, we show that TC predicts various measures of ecosystem functioning, and generate a range of testable predictions. We find that, in addition to the number of species, the structure of their interactions needs to be accounted for to predict ecosystem productivity.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12118/full","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12118","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"ENG","author":[{"family":"Poisot","given":"Timothée"},{"family":"Mouquet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,2]]},"container-title-short":"Ecol.

Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analysing whether evolutionary history—represented by taxonomic classification—provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxonomic ranks (kingdom to class). Our methods provide a way to explicitly include evolutionary history in models for food web structure.","URL":"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/279/1733/1588","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2011.2149","ISSN":"0962-8452, 1471-2954","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Eklöf","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Helmus","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Moore","given":"M."},{"family":"Allesina","given":"Stefano"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,22]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,18]]},"PMID":"22090387"},

Additionally, demographic processes, dispersal, and interspecific interactions with other species are shaping species distributions, resulting in the realised niche. Understanding the complex interplay between these drivers is vital for making robust biodiversity predictions to novel environments. Correlative species distribution models have been widely used to predict biodiversity response but also remain criticised, as they are not able to properly disentangle the abiotic and biotic drivers shaping species’ niches. Recent developments have thus focussed on (i) integrating demography and dispersal into species distribution models, and on (ii) integrating interspecific interactions. Here, I review recent demographic and multi-species modelling approaches and discuss critical aspects of these models that remain underexplored in general and in respect to birds, for example, the complex life histories of birds and other animals as well as the scale dependence of interspecific interactions. I conclude by formulating modelling guidelines for integrating the abiotic and biotic processes that limit species’ ranges, which will help to disentangle the complex roles of demography, dispersal and interspecific interactions in shaping species niches. Throughout, I pinpoint complexities of avian life cycles that are critical for consideration in the models and identify data requirements for operationalizing the different modelling steps.

However, the changes in network interactions associated with turnover in community composition have seldom been assessed. Here we examine whether changes in ecological networks are best detected by standard emergent network metrics or by assessing internal network changes (i.e. interaction and composition turnover). To eliminate possible spatial or phylogenetic effects, that in large-scale studies may obscure mechanisms structuring networks and interactions, we sampled multiple antagonistic (plant–herbivore) networks for a single diverse plant family (the Restionaceae) in the hyperdiverse Cape Floristic Region. These are the first plant–herbivore networks constructed for this global biodiversity hotspot. We found invariant emergent network structure despite considerable changes in insect and plant composition across communities over time and space. In contrast, there was high interaction turnover between networks. Seasonally, this was driven by turnover in insect species and insect host switching. Spatially, this was driven by simultaneous turnover in plant and insect species, suggesting that many insects are host specific or that both groups exhibit parallel responses to environmental gradients. Spatial interaction turnover was also driven by turnover in plants, showing that many insects can utilise multiple (possibly closely related) hosts and this may create divergent selection gradients that promote insect speciation. Thus we show highly variable interaction fidelity, despite invariant emergent network structure. We suggest that evaluating internal network changes may be more effective at elucidating the processes structuring networks, and many fine-scale changes may be obscured when only calculating emergent network metrics.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02150/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.02150","ISSN":"1600-0587","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Kemp","given":"Jurene E."},{"family":"Evans","given":"Darren M."},{"family":"Augustyn","given":"Willem J."},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Allan G."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,21]]},"container-title-short":"Ecography"},

As a consequence, ecological networks have been placed in spatial and temporal contexts in order to reveal what may drive network variability. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of ecological networks, and in particular the underlying forces facilitating changes, seems pertinent in our attempts to understand and anticipate how ecological networks may vary and respond to future environmental scenarios.\n\n\n* Network variability has been studied at widely differing temporal and spatial scales. For example, studies exploring temporal variability ranges from within-season comparisons to comparisons over vast geological time spans, and the spatial extent ranges from the scale of a single pond to global analyses. Here, we highlight the outcomes from such studies and emphasize the identified mechanisms driving spatio-temporal variability in ecological networks. Specifically, we describe how ecological networks vary over different temporal (years, centuries and millennia) and spatial (local, regional and global) scales, discuss how this variability is monitored and identify potential future directions.\n\n\n* Present knowledge allows some tentative generalizations. First, ecological networks tend to exhibit considerable spatial and temporal stability in several macroscopic features (e.g. connectance, nestedness), but studies also show that macroscopic features may change, for example, in relation to mass extinction or steep environmental gradients. Secondly, microscopic features (e.g. individual specialization levels, species roles and partner affiliations), albeit less studied, seem to show strong variability, and in several cases, microscopic instability co-occurs with macroscopic stability. We therefore recommend a stronger focus on this macro–micro interplay and list ideas (e.g. temporal species centrality measures and interaction phenologies), towards expanding the microscopic toolbox of network ecologists.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12710/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.12710","ISSN":"1365-2435","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Trøjelsgaard","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Jens M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,7,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",9,1]]},"title-short":"Ecological networks in motion","container-title-short":"Funct Ecol"},

Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant–pollinator and 24 plant–frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant–animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant–animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00403.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00403.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Jordano","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Bascompte","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Jens M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,21]]}},

Two widespread structures in ecological networks are modularity, i.e. weakly connected subgroups of species that are internally highly interlinked, and nestedness, i.e. specialist species that interact with a subset of those species with which generalist species also interact. Modularity and nestedness are often interpreted as evolutionary ecological structures that may have relevance for community persistence and resilience against perturbations, such as climate-change. Therefore, historical climatic fluctuations could influence modularity and nestedness, but this possibility remains untested. This lack of research is in sharp contrast to the considerable efforts to disentangle the role of historical climate-change and contemporary climate on species distributions, richness and community composition patterns. Here, we use a global database of pollination networks to show that historical climate-change is at least as important as contemporary climate in shaping modularity and nestedness of pollination networks. Specifically, on the mainland we found a relatively strong negative association between Quaternary climate-change and modularity, whereas nestedness was most prominent in areas having experienced high Quaternary climate-change. On islands, Quaternary climate-change had weak effects on modularity and no effects on nestedness. Hence, for both modularity and nestedness, historical climate-change has left imprints on the network structure of mainland communities, but had comparably little effect on island communities. Our findings highlight a need to integrate historical climate fluctuations into eco-evolutionary hypotheses of network structures, such as modularity and nestedness, and then test these against empirical data. We propose that historical climate-change may have left imprints in the structural organisation of species interactions in an array of systems important for maintaining biological diversity.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00201.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00201.x","ISSN":"1600-0587","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Dalsgaard","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Trøjelsgaard","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Martín González","given":"Ana M."},{"family":"Nogués-Bravo","given":"David"},{"family":"Ollerton","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Petanidou","given":"Theodora"},{"family":"Sandel","given":"Brody"},{"family":"Schleuning","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhiheng"},{"family":"Rahbek","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Sutherland","given":"William J."},{"family":"Svenning","given":"Jens-Christian"},{"family":"Olesen","given":"Jens M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,12,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,21]]},"container-title-short":"Ecography"},

We found that species’ roles for hosts and parasitoids were heterogeneously distributed across the study system but that roles are strongly conserved over spatial scales. In addition, we found that species’ roles were remarkably consistent between years even in the presence of disturbances (e.g. species turnover). Overall, our results suggest that species’ roles are an intrinsic property of species that may be predictable over spatial and temporal scales.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.00913/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.00913","ISSN":"1600-0587","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"Nick J."},{"family":"Kaartinen","given":"Riikka"},{"family":"Roslin","given":"Tomas"},{"family":"Stouffer","given":"Daniel B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,21]]},"container-title-short":"Ecography"},

Thus, as older taxa have produced more individuals over time, and smaller taxa have higher population sizes and faster generation times, the Latitudinal Diversity Gradients (LDGs) of these clades should show shallower slopes. We describe the LDGs for archaea, bacteria, fungi, invertebrates and trees from six North American forests. For three focal groups—bacteria, ants, and trees—older taxa had shallower LDG slopes than the more recent, terminal taxa. Across 12 orders of magnitude of body mass, LDG slopes were steeper in larger taxa. The slopes of LDGs vary systematically with body size and clade age, underscoring the non-canonical nature of LDGs. The steepest LDG slopes were found for the largest organisms while the smallest, from bacteria to small litter-soil invertebrates, have shallower- to zero-slope LDGs. If tropical niche conservatism is the failure of clades to adapt to, and diversify in temperate habitats, then the steep LDGs of chordates and plants likely arise from the decreased ability of clades with large individuals to adapt to the multiple challenges of extra-tropical life.

Historically, much effort has focused on niche-mediated processes to explain these structures, while an emerging consensus posits that both niche and neutral mechanisms simultaneously shape many features of ecological communities. However, the study of interaction networks still lacks a comprehensive neutral theory. Here we present a neutral model of predator-prey interactions and analyze the structural characteristics of the simulated networks. We find that connectance values (complexity) and complexity-diversity relationships of neutral networks are close to those observed in empirical bipartite networks. High nestedness and low modularity values observed in neutral networks fall in the range of those from empirical antagonist bipartite networks. Our results suggest that, as an alternative to niche-mediated processes that induce incompatibility between species (“niche forbidden links”), neutral processes create “neutral forbidden links” due to uneven species abundance distributions and the low probability of interaction between rare species. Neutral trophic networks must be seen as the missing endpoint of a continuum from niche to purely stochastic approaches of community organization.","URL":"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0038295","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0038295","ISSN":"1932-6203","author":[{"family":"Canard","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Mouquet","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Marescot","given":"Lucile"},{"family":"Gaston","given":"Kevin J."},{"family":"Gravel","given":"Dominique"},{"family":"Mouillot","given":"David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,21]]},"container-title-short":"PLOS ONE"},

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions.

Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of β-diversity. We emphasise that scaling up β-diversity of community composition to the β-diversity of interactions requires only a small methodological step, which we foresee will help empiricists adopt this method.

Additionally, demographic processes, dispersal, and interspecific interactions with other species are shaping species distributions, resulting in the realised niche. Understanding the complex interplay between these drivers is vital for making robust biodiversity predictions to novel environments. Correlative species distribution models have been widely used to predict biodiversity response but also remain criticised, as they are not able to properly disentangle the abiotic and biotic drivers shaping species’ niches. Recent developments have thus focussed on (i) integrating demography and dispersal into species distribution models, and on (ii) integrating interspecific interactions. Here, I review recent demographic and multi-species modelling approaches and discuss critical aspects of these models that remain underexplored in general and in respect to birds, for example, the complex life histories of birds and other animals as well as the scale dependence of interspecific interactions. I conclude by formulating modelling guidelines for integrating the abiotic and biotic processes that limit species’ ranges, which will help to disentangle the complex roles of demography, dispersal and interspecific interactions in shaping species niches. Throughout, I pinpoint complexities of avian life cycles that are critical for consideration in the models and identify data requirements for operationalizing the different modelling steps.

We also highlight how behavior can foster interactions that, from traits, would be predicted to be forbidden. We therefore discuss the drawbacks of frameworks recently developed to infer biotic interactions using available trait data (mean values).

We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects.

These findings have implications for the understanding of community structure, evolution, and response to perturbation.\nResearch on the relationship between the architecture of ecological networks and community stability has mainly focused on one type of interaction at a time, making difficult any comparison between different network types. We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.\nEcological network architecture differs between models of trophic (herbivore) and mutualistic (pollination) communities.\nEcological network architecture differs between models of trophic (herbivore) and mutualistic (pollination) communities.","URL":"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/329/5993/853","DOI":"10.1126/science.1188321","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Thébault","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Fontaine","given":"Colin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,8,13]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,17]]},"PMID":"20705861"},

This contradiction has puzzled biologists for decades. While some have explored how stability may be achieved in small modules of a few interacting species, rigorous demonstrations of how large complex and ecologically realistic networks dynamically persist remain scarce and inadequately understood. Here, we help fill this void by combining structural models of complex food webs with nonlinear bioenergetic models of population dynamics parameterized by biological rates that are allometrically scaled to populations’ average body masses. Increasing predator–prey body mass ratios increase population persistence up to a saturation level that is reached by invertebrate and ectotherm vertebrate predators when being 10 or 100 times larger than their prey respectively. These values are corroborated by empirical predator–prey body mass ratios from a global data base. Moreover, negative effects of diversity (i.e. species richness) on stability (i.e. population persistence) become neutral or positive relationships at these empirical ratios. These results demonstrate that the predator–prey body mass ratios found in nature may be key to enabling persistence of populations in complex food webs and stabilizing the diversity of natural ecosystems.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00978.x/abstract","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2006.00978.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Brose","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Neo D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,11,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,22]]}},
