# Linking interactions to ecological mechanisms

It is worth remembering that ecological interactions are the direct
expression of ecological mechanisms. A pollinator is able to effectively
reach the nectar in a plant because the traits of the two organisms match,
because they have compatible phenologies, and because they occur in the same
environment. A virus can infect its host because it is able to attach to the
cell surface, effectively penetrate it, and hijack the cellular machinery
to its benefit. Interactions that are not allowed because trait values do
not match have been called "forbidden links" [@oles11mfl]. This prompted
a search for "linkage rules" [@bart13ulr] in ecological networks, *i.e.*
the relationships that must exist between traits borne by two organisms
in order for an interaction between them to exist. These can be identified
from existing data on traits and interactions [@bart16cfi], and then used to
generate realistic ecological networks [@crea15nme]. @gonz16llf point out that
interactions are happening between individuals: this requires to consider how
the traits are distributed at the individual scale, but also how different
behaviors may allow organisms to overcome some of the forbidden links.
