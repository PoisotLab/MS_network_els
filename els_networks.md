# Invariants in ecological networks

One striking particularity of ecological networks is their consistency:
even though the depict interactions between different organisms across all
sorts of ecosystems, they all tend to look the same [@jord03ipc]. Remarkably,
even when interactions among species themselves vary (see section **x**),
the overall network structure tends to remain unchanged [@kemp17ian]. Most
ecological networks have a very specific degree distribution [@will11bmc],
whereby most species have a small number of interactions, and a small
proportions of species have a large number of interactions. In food webs,
which represent interactions between preys and their predators, there is a
well-described relationship between the number of species and the number of
interactions: the number of interactions ($L$) increases proportionally to the
number of species ($L$) raised to some exponent, or $L \propto S^k$. @mart92ccc
suggested that this exponent is approximately equal to 2, *i.e.* the number
of interactions is proportional to the squared number of species. @bros04uss
show that this general relationship holds even across space: it is possible
to estimate how many interactions a species will establish across its entire
range. In some other instances, networks may differ on some aspect of their
structure, despite obeying to a shared underlying principle. For example,
@fort10nme show that in networks with a low connectance, nestedness (the
degree to which the diet of specialists and generalists overlaps) and
modularity (the tendency of species to form densely aggregated clusters)
are positively correlated. In networks with higher connectance, this became
the opposite: networks with a large number of interactions were either nested
(and not modular) or modular (and not nested). In the recent years, it emerged
that many aspects of network structure covary with connectance [@chag15cte;
@pois14wen]: this suggests that simply knowing how many species there are,
and how many interactions they establish, is already very informative about
the network structure.

# Linking interactions to ecological mechanisms

It is worth remembering that ecological interactions are the direct
expression of ecological mechanisms. A pollinator is able to effectively
reach the nectar in a plant because the traits of the two organisms match,
because they have compatible phenologies, and because they occur in the same
environment. A virus can infect its host because it is able to attach to the
cell surface, effectively penetrate it, and hijack the cellular machinery
to its benefit. Interactions that are not allowed because trait values do
not match have been called "forbidden links" [@oles11mfl]. This prompted
a search for "linkage rules" [@bart13ulr] in ecological networks, *i.e.*
the relationships that must exist between traits borne by two organisms
in order for an interaction between them to exist. These can be identified
from existing data on traits and interactions [@bart16cfi], and then used
to generate realistic ecological networks [@crea15nme]. @gonz16llf point out
that interactions are happening between individuals: this requires to consider
how the traits are distributed at the individual scale, but also how different
behaviors may allow organisms to overcome some of the forbidden links. Although
traits are an important part of what makes interactions happen, they are only
relevant insofar as the organisms are able to encounter one another. The
importance of neutral dynamics (*i.e.* how abundances of different species
can determine the probability that they can interact, based on how often they
would bump into one another by chance) is, somewhat counter-intuitively,
great. @cana12esp reveals that simulating food web dynamics by using only
population abundances to predict interactions yields realistic food webs. In
a host-parasite system, local abundances has also been identified as a
key predictor of species interactions [@cana14een]. Speaking more broadly,
because interactions emerge from all of these ecological mechanisms, there
is a need to develop a deeper understanding of them [@pois15swe]. Beyond
the fundamental advance that this represents, this would allow to predict
interactions based on external information [@mora15ibi].
