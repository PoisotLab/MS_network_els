# Invariants in ecological networks

One striking particularity of ecological networks is their consistency:
even though the depict interactions between different organisms across all
sorts of ecosystems, they all tend to look the same [@jord03ipc]. Remarkably,
even when interactions among species themselves vary (see section **x**),
the overall network structure tends to remain unchanged [@kemp17ian]. Most
ecological networks have a very specific degree distribution [@will11bmc],
whereby most species have a small number of interactions, and a small
proportions of species have a large number of interactions. In food webs,
which represent interactions between preys and their predators, there is a
well-described relationship between the number of species and the number of
interactions: the number of interactions ($L$) increases proportionally to the
number of species ($L$) raised to some exponent, or $L \propto S^k$. @mart92ccc
suggested that this exponent is approximately equal to 2, *i.e.* the number
of interactions is proportional to the squared number of species. @bros04uss
show that this general relationship holds even across space: it is possible
to estimate how many interactions a species will establish across its entire
range. In some other instances, networks may differ on some aspect of their
structure, despite obeying to a shared underlying principle. For example,
@fort10nme show that in networks with a low connectance, nestedness (the
degree to which the diet of specialists and generalists overlaps) and
modularity (the tendency of species to form densely aggregated clusters)
are positively correlated. In networks with higher connectance, this became
the opposite: networks with a large number of interactions were either nested
(and not modular) or modular (and not nested). In the recent years, it emerged
that many aspects of network structure covary with connectance [@chag15cte;
@pois14wen]: this suggests that simply knowing how many species there are,
and how many interactions they establish, is already very informative about
the network structure.
