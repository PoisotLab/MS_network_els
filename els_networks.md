# Linking interactions to ecological mechanisms

It is worth remembering that ecological interactions are the direct
expression of ecological mechanisms. A pollinator is able to effectively
reach the nectar in a plant because the traits of the two organisms match,
because they have compatible phenologies, and because they occur in the same
environment. A virus can infect its host because it is able to attach to the
cell surface, effectively penetrate it, and hijack the cellular machinery
to its benefit. Interactions that are not allowed because trait values do
not match have been called "forbidden links" [@oles11mfl]. This prompted
a search for "linkage rules" [@bart13ulr] in ecological networks, *i.e.*
the relationships that must exist between traits borne by two organisms
in order for an interaction between them to exist. These can be identified
from existing data on traits and interactions [@bart16cfi], and then used
to generate realistic ecological networks [@crea15nme]. @gonz16llf point out
that interactions are happening between individuals: this requires to consider
how the traits are distributed at the individual scale, but also how different
behaviors may allow organisms to overcome some of the forbidden links. Although
traits are an important part of what makes interactions happen, they are only
relevant insofar as the organisms are able to encounter one another. The
importance of neutral dynamics (*i.e.* how abundances of different species
can determine the probability that they can interact, based on how often they
would bump into one another by chance) is, somewhat counter-intuitively,
great. @cana12esp reveals that simulating food web dynamics by using only
population abundances to predict interactions yields realistic food webs. In
a host-parasite system, local abundances has also been identified as a
key predictor of species interactions [@cana14een]. Speaking more broadly,
because interactions emerge from all of these ecological mechanisms, there
is a need to develop a deeper understanding of them [@pois15swe]. Beyond
the fundamental advance that this represents, this would allow to predict
interactions based on external information [@mora15ibi].
